013	A trap representation is produced by a side effect that modifies any part of the object using an lvalue expression that does not have character type (6.2.6.1). 
014	The operands to certain operators are such that they could produce a negative zero result, but the implementation does not support negative zeros (6.2.6.2). 
018	Demotion of one real floating type to another produces a value outside the range that can be represented (6.3.1.5). 
024	Conversion of a pointer to an integer type produces a value outside the range that can be represented (6.3.2.3). 
025	Conversion between two pointer types produces a result that is incorrectly aligned (6.3.2.3). 
031	Two identifiers differ only in nonsignificant characters (6.4.2.1). 
050	The result of subtracting two pointers is not representable in an object of type ptrdiff_t (6.5.6).
