Install Perl
	- Install perl 
	- install XML::Twig (probably using either cpan or ppm)

Install Maude:
	- go to http://maude.cs.uiuc.edu/ and install the Maude rewrite system on your machine
	
Install K:
	- go to http://code.google.com/p/k-framework/ and check out the K Semantic Framework from http://code.google.com/p/k-framework/source/checkout
	- Check that the installation of K works by running their 'make test' command in their /examples directory

Build our tool:
	- set K_MAUDE_BASE to the full (non-relative) path in which you installed the K framework.  e.g., export K_MAUDE_BASE=~/k-framework/trunk
	- run "make" in our main directory, the directory of this README

Interpret a program:
	- dist/kcc program.c
	- ./a.out
	
	Take a look at 'kcc -h' for some options.
	
Generate pdf versions of the semantics:
	- run 'make pdf'
	- Currently this creates only a few pdfs in the /semantics directory.  They are still rough, but should help understanding the semantics
	
Links to help understand K:
	- http://code.google.com/p/k-framework/
	- http://fsl.cs.uiuc.edu/K See particularly:
		- Traian Serbanuta's thesis defense slides (http://fsl.cs.uiuc.edu/pubs/serbanuta-2010-thesis-slides.pdf) for a high level overview 
		- "An Overview of the K Semantic Framework" from the Journal of Logic and Algebraic Programming (http://fsl.cs.uiuc.edu/pubs/rosu-serbanuta-2010-jlap.pdf) for a detailed explanation
