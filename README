Please let us know if you had to do any extra steps to install!
Send an e-mail to k-user@cs.uiuc.edu with questions.

Install Perl
	- Perl is used for many of the scripts in both C and K
	- Install perl modules (probably using either cpan or ppm)
		- XML::Twig
		- XML::DOM
		- XML::LibXML::Reader
		- Regexp::Common
		- Tree::Nary

Install Maude:
	- go to http://maude.cs.uiuc.edu/ and install the Maude rewrite system on your machine
	- K requires at least version 2.5

Install Ocaml (http://caml.inria.fr/):
	- OCaml is used in the C parser
	
Install GHC (http://www.haskell.org/ghc/):
	- Necessary for the K Output Filter, which the C interpreter uses.
	- The GHC prereqs needed by this tool are available in k-framework/tools/OutputFilter/OutputFilter.cabal
	- If you'd like to avoid installing GHC, you may be able to use a precompiled static binary (so far only linux_64 available) by saying:
		OUTPUT_FILTER=../k-framework/tools/OutputFilter/static-bin/linux_64/filterOutput make
		or similar if your static binary is in another place, when you do the "make" below.
	
Set up K:
	- go to http://code.google.com/p/k-framework/ and check out the K Semantic Framework from http://code.google.com/p/k-framework/source/checkout
	- Check that all K prereqs are met by running:
		- 'make test' command in their k-framework/examples directory
		- 'make test' command in their k-framework/regressionTests directory

Optional Install:
	- You may want to install graphviz, for generating images of the state space when searching programs.
		
Build our tool:
	- set K_MAUDE_BASE to the full (non-relative) path in which you installed the K framework.  e.g., export K_MAUDE_BASE=~/k-framework/trunk
	- run "make" in our main directory, the directory of this README
	- if building the OutputFilter fails due to lack of prerequisites, just go to the k-framework/tools/OutputFilter/ directory and run "cabal install", then retry the build of C

Interpret a program:
	- dist/kcc program.c
	- ./a.out
	
	Take a look at 'kcc -h' for some compile-time options.  After compiling a program, running "HELP=1 ./a.out" will display some "runtime" options, including SEARCH and PROFILE.
	
	
Generate pdf versions of the semantics (INCOMPLETE):
	- run 'make pdf'
	- Currently this creates only a few pdfs in the /semantics directory.  They are still rough, but should help understanding the semantics
	
Links to help understand K:
	- http://code.google.com/p/k-framework/
	- http://fsl.cs.uiuc.edu/K See particularly:
		- Traian Serbanuta's thesis defense slides (http://fsl.cs.uiuc.edu/pubs/serbanuta-2010-thesis-slides.pdf) for a high level overview 
		- "An Overview of the K Semantic Framework" from the Journal of Logic and Algebraic Programming (http://fsl.cs.uiuc.edu/pubs/rosu-serbanuta-2010-jlap.pdf) for a detailed explanation
